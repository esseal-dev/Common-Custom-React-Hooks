# Common-Custom-React-Hooks
- Helper repo with some react hooks we use commonly on projects.
- All hooks have a JS & TS version
- We use `any` in all the typescript versions to keep things generalized, it's better to change that to your specific use cases.
- More hooks will be added as we fine tune them and have the time to work on this repo.

Open to suggestions & request for hooks of certain use cases.
